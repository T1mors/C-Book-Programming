This directory contains sample and solution programs from
the chapter "Scripts" of the book
A.K. Hartmann "A big practical guide to computer simulations" 
(World Scientific, 2014)


First program
--------------
The Python script realizes a loop and some list operations
SOURCES:
  loop.py 
COMPILE:
  ---
RUN:
  loops.py


String handling
---------------
The Python script shows some examples for string operations
SOURCES:
  strings.py 
COMPILE:
  ---
RUN:
  strings.py


Dictionaries
--------------
The Python script gives some examples on hwo to you disctionaries
SOURCES:
  dict.py 
COMPILE:
  ---
RUN:
  dict.py


Merging files
--------------
The Python script shows how for two data files the columns
of the files can be merged into one file. In particular file
access in Python can be learned from this sample.
SOURCES:
  mix_files.py
  test1.dat
  test2.dat 
COMPILE:
  ---
RUN:
  mix_files.py


Functions in Python
-------------------
The Python script shows how to define and use functions.
SOURCES:
  functions.py 
COMPILE:
  ---
RUN:
  functions.py


Resampling
--------------
The Python script shows how error bars of complex quantities
can be obtained via "resampling". For didactical reasons, the
data is just randomly generated within the script.
SOURCES:
  resampling.py 
COMPILE:
  ---
RUN:
  resampling.py
