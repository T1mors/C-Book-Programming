histograms
----------
(includes also solution to exercise)
Data structure for histograms (plus extra entries for moments), 
functions to create and delete histograms, 
to insert number into histogram and to return mean
Main function generates exponentially distributed random numbers
and puts them into histogram, prints mean (or pdf if -DSOLUTION)
solution to exercise: print histogram as pdf
SOURCES:
  histo.h   
  histo.c
  histo_main.c
  histo_fprint_pdf.c  (solution to exercise)
COMPILE:
  cc -o histo  histo.c main_histo.c  -lm
  cc -o histo  histo.c main_histo.c histo_fprint_pdf.c -lm -DSOLUTION
RUN:
  histo
  OR
  histo <seed>


histograms in C++
-----------------
(includes also solution to exercise)
Data structure for histograms (plus extra entries for moments), 
functions to create and delete histograms, 
to insert number into histogram, to print histogram and
to return mean.
Main function generates exponentially distributed random numbers
and puts them into histogram, prints mean (twice, via
copying a histogram) if -DSLUTION is used as well.
SOURCES:
  histo++.h
  histo.cpp
  histo_main.cpp
  histoSOL.cpp  (solution to exercises)
COMPILE:
  c++ -o histo main_histo.cpp histo.cpp -lm
  c++ -o histo main_histo.cpp histo.cpp histoSOL.cpp -lm -DSOLUTION
RUN:
  histo
  OR
  histo <seed>
